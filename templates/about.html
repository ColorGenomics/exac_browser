<!-- <h1>FLOSSIES’ inspiration, participants, and sequencing.</h1> -->
<br />
<p>The FLOSSIES sequencing project was inspired by the need for frequencies of genomic variants from appropriate controls for breast cancer genetics studies. Existing public databases are large, but not stratified by sex or age. <nobr>The FLOSSIES project</nobr> includes allele frequencies of all classes of variants in genes at known and candidate genes for breast cancer susceptibility among women who are cancer free and older than age 70. We hope this data will be useful as controls for breast cancer genetics studies by many groups.</p>

<h3>Participants</h3>

<p>FLOSSIES participants are women who joined the <a href="https://www.whi.org/SitePages/WHI%20Home.aspx">Women’s Health Initiative</a> (WHI) between 1993 and 2005. All participants were 50-79 years old and had no history of cancer at enrollment. More than 160,000 women enrolled in WHI, contributed DNA at enrollment, and have been followed ever since. From the WHI participants who are now older than 70 and have remained cancer-free, approximately 10,000 women were selected at random for this sequencing project: approximately 7,500 who self-identified as European American and approximately 2,500 who self-identified as African American. Ancestries were confirmed with approximately 500 ancestry-informative markers.</p>

<h3>Genes</h3>

<p>Genes analyzed include established breast cancer genes, both high and moderate penetrance, and genes that have been suggested to predispose to breast cancer when mutant. Strength of evidence varies for these candidate genes. The genes are:</p>

<p><em>BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, BAP1, BARD1, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK1, CHEK2, CTNNA1, FAM175A, FANCM, GEN1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RECQL, RINT 1, SLX4, STK11, TP53, XRCC2</em></p>

<p>For each gene, rare and common variants in coding regions, 5’UTR, 3’UTR, donor splice sites with 6 flanking bp, and acceptor splice sites with 20 flanking bp are included. Point mutations, small indels, and CNVs are included (although CNV calls are still incomplete in v1).</p>

<h3>Sequencing</h3>

<p>Sequencing was carried out in the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/king.htm">King Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, Seattle, and by <a href="https://www.color.com/">Color Genomics</a> on an Illumina HiSeq with 2x100 bp paired-end reads (King Lab) or NextSeq with 2x150 bp paired-end reads (Color) using modified versions of the BROCA panel<a id="1" href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a>. Median coverage per sample was >250x.</p>

<p>Paired-end sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner 0.7.9a. Removal of PCR duplicates, sorting, and indexing were carried out with SAMtools v0.1.19. Data was excluded for 3 samples with low coverage and 2 samples with low quality. For quality control, WHI included 105 duplicates and 20 triplicates, blinded to the sequencing teams. These duplicates and triplicates were all identified and removed.</p>

<p>Indel realignments and base quality score recalibration were based on with Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK; v3.0-0) using recommended parameters. Variants were detected with GATK Unified Genotyper. Variants were included if variant fraction was at least 0.25. Copy number variants were identified using our read-depth-based in-house pipeline.</p>

<h3>Ancestry confirmation</h3>

<p>Ancestry of each sample was confirmed using 500 ancestry-informative markers and principal components analysis<a id="2" href="#footnotes"><sup>2</sup></a>, calibrating to genotypes from Human Genome Diversity Panel<a id="3" href="#footnotes"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Each sample was assigned to the population with highest estimated likelihood of ancestry.</p>

<p>Ancestry analysis yielded estimates of 7,239 women of European American ancestry and 2,530 women of African American ancestry.</p>

<h3>Collaborators</h3>
<p>The FLOSSIES project is a joint effort of the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/king.htm">King Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> (Tom Walsh, Suleyman Gulsuner, Ming Lee, and Mary-Claire King), <a href="https://www.color.com/">Color Genomics</a> (Jeroen Van den Akker, Wendy McKennon, Robert O’Conner, Taylor Sittler, and Elad Gil), and the <a href="https://www.whi.org/">Women’s Health Initiative</a> (Megan Skinner Herndon, Peggy Porter, and Garnet Anderson).
