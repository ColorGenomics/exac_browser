<p>All genetic variants in this database are from germline DNA of approximately 10,000 women (approximately 7,500 European American and 2,500 African American), older than 70, who have never had cancer. The participants are Fabulous Ladies Over Seventy.
</p>
<p>Germline DNA of each participant has been sequenced for 27 genes known or suggested to harbor mutations that increase risk for breast cancer. Frequencies and profiles of variants in these healthy older women can serve as controls for evaluating variants encountered in these genes.
